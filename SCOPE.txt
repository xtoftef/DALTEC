The changes below were successfully implemented in the latest udpate:
- More in depth and accurate algorithm for a better estimate
- inclusion of the main leveling settings on the bot's dashboard(only support for linear curve and x1 multiplier)
- Taking into account roles and their respective boosts
- message xp calculator
- voice xp calculator

In the works:
- GUI python file using Tkinter (will likely have a separate branch of its own)

Future plans:
- GUI application
- ability for the user to save their own presets for the settings and reuse them as needed.
- possibly making a script for a standalone Discord bot making use of an adapted version of this script.
