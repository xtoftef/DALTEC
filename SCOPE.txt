Below are the features I currently work on:
- More in depth and accurate algorithm for a better estimate
- inclusion of the main leveling settings on the bot's dashboard(only support for linear curve and x1 multiplier)
- Taking into account roles and their respective boosts
- message xp calculator
- voice xp calculator


Future plans:
- GUI application
- ability for the user to save their own presets for the settings and reuse them as needed.
- possibly making a script for a standalone Discord bot making use of an adapted version of this script.
